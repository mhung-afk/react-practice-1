# Exercise 1 - Search User React App

## Description
To practise and review React concepts, we are going to implement a simple React App. In details, we need to create a page that includes a search bar. When you enter inputs on the search bar, a result table should appear and contain all user records which have their **emails** or **usernames** matched the **search string**. Additionally, the table has a button **Edit All** that will allows you to be able to edit all rendering user records. 

## Implementation instructions
1. You can design the page up to yourself. TailwindCSS is already setup for the project.
2. User records will be provided at the file **MOCK_DATA.json**.
3. You should seperate your implementation into many GIT commits, so I can review your progress closely. Avoid commiting all GIT commits in the end.

## Example
The result table should be:
| Username    | Email | Birthday | Edit All |
| -------- | ------- | ---------| ------------|
| johnson  | john.son1246@hotmail.com    | 1980/05/20 | |
| garfield  | garfy@edu.uk    | 1999/07/06 | |
| shara.mangoes  | shara.man@gmail.com    | 2001/11/29 | |
